{-
My guess is what happens is this: now that the main function is fully expanded
and appears to evaluate to a list (at that, a list of requests. Notice how
AppendChan, which is an element of the algebraic data type Request, is being
consed to a bunch of stuff to its right)
it can be applied to a magical response list that keeps getting filled up
like a bottomless wine glass* with the response to the head element of the
request list.

*This is the "clever footwork" mentioned on P. 4 of Tackling Awkward Squad:
    "There has to be some clever footwork to deal with the
    fact that the function has to be applied to a list of
    responses before there are any responses in the list,
    but that isnâ€™t a problem in a lazy setting."

-- here's how I think it goes down:

-- apply main to empty magic list, which kicks off running first AppendChan
= (AppendChan stdout "please type a filename\n") : succDispatch exit
        ((ReadChan stdin) : strDispatch exit
            (\ userInput -> (AppendChan stdout userInput) : succDispatch exit done )
        )
        [] -- empty magic wine glass kick-off

-- AppendChan does its thing, now there's a response in the response list
= succDispatch exit
        ((ReadChan stdin) : strDispatch exit
            (\ userInput -> (AppendChan stdout userInput) : succDispatch exit done )
        )
        [Success]

-- expand succDispatch and you've got a similar situation where there's an
-- "empty" list that's about to get a response from ReadChan
= (ReadChan stdin) : strDispatch exit
        (\ userInput -> (AppendChan stdout userInput) : succDispatch exit done )
        []

-- ReadChan does its thing, now there's a response in the response list
= strDispatch exit
        (\ userInput -> (AppendChan stdout userInput) : succDispatch exit done )
        [Str "coolfile.hs"]

-- expand strDispatch and you've got a similar situation where there's an
-- "empty" list that's about to get a response from AppendChan
= ((\ userInput -> (AppendChan stdout userInput) : succDispatch exit done ) "coolfile.hs")
  []
= (AppendChan stdout "coolfile.hs") : succDispatch exit done []

-- AppendChan does its thing, now there's a response in the response list
