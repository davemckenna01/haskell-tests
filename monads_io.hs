{-
The reason for making IO monadic has nothing to do with it lessening impurity
and everything to do with ensuring order of IO operations. 

But, why is IO getting out of order a risk? Because the compiler assumes
everything is pure and could possibly rearrange expressions UNLESS it sees
a data dependency.

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dependency)

This is your bible:
https://wiki.haskell.org/IO_inside

It says:
"The Haskell language doesn't provide any way to express order of evaluation... except for data dependencies"

This means the IO monad simply ensures there are data dependencies among a sequence of 
IO operations. That is, if T1, T2, T3 are operations, IO constructs a sequence
such that T3 takes a result of T2 as a parameter, and T2 takes a result of T1
as a parameter. So the only way the compiler can interpret that is that T1 must
be run first, followed by T2 then T3.

There's no getting around the fact that IO will be impure, b/c it interacts with the outside world
aka the OS. getChar will not return the same value every time it's run, so it's impure. It
will also have a side effect of shortening the length of a kernel buffer by consuming a char.
putChar will return the same thing every time, a (), but it has a side effect of adding to
some kernel buffer, so it's impure in that way. BUT WHO CARES! No usefull program
can ever be pure. The best you can hope for is that a lot of your program is, so that you
get as much of the benefits of purity (compiler optimizations, laziness, etc.)


Q: Why would the compiler reorder? Is it simply because no order is specified 
so it arbitrarily chooses order? Or does it try and run stuff in parallel? I
feel like purity buys you easy concurrency. Laziness buys you stuff too, and it
requires purity I think. Referential transparency is basically another word for
purity, isn't it?

--IO a really means the following:
newtype IO a = IO (State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, a #))

-- so when getChar says it's an IO a, it's really a IO (State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, a #))

{-
State# is an "unboxed type" which is an optimization that makes it refer
to a primitive value (think C values like int and float) rather than a thunk,
which is what most "normal" Haskell values are (right??). They're put on the
stack instead of heap, which is faster I guess?

(# a, b #) is an "unboxed tuple" serving a similar purpose.

{-
the State# RealWorld is simply used to preserve statement order:
"GHC uses impure primitives to implement these IO operations (getChar etc); the State# RealWorld
"values" are only to stop the compiler reordering statements by introducing
DATA DEPENDENCIES from one statement to the next."*
... it's not actually the entire state of the world! It's just some arbitrary number. And I'm
not sure if the number changes or not from one impure IO to the next.

* but, I've read also that case statements are strict in Haskell, and some have
implied that this is the reason IO is guaranteed to be ordered. I could have
misunderstood. Here: "The repeated case-expressions, however, ensure our optimizer
                     doesnâ€™t reorder the IO instructions (since that would have
                     a very observable effect!)"
                    (http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/05/unraveling-the-mystery-of-the-io-monad/)
... but maybe he means they won't get reordered b/c the pattern-matched value is actually 
used in subsequent statements, which is a DATA DEPENDENCY. But why would case
be necessary, couldn't we just do lets, or wheres, as in https://wiki.haskell.org/IO_inside ?


So in the IO's >>=, is it the usage of case, the usage of State RealWorld, or
both that ensures order?


Note also:
The IO monad is not a state monad, despite popular belief. The state monad looks very similar to the type GHC uses for IO. Thus the confusion.
Notice the reversed order of values in state vs io return tuple.
